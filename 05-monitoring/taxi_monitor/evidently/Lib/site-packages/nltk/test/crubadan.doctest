Crubadan Corpus Reader
======================

Crubadan is an NLTK corpus reader for ngram files provided
by the Crubadan project. It supports several languages.

    >>> from nltk.corpus import crubadan
    >>> crubadan.langs()
    ['abk', 'abn',..., 'zpa', 'zul']

----------------------------------------
Language code mapping and helper methods
----------------------------------------

The web crawler that generates the 3-gram frequencies works at the
level of "writing systems" rather than languages. Writing systems
are assigned internal 2-3 letter codes that require mapping to the
standard ISO 639-3 codes. For more information, please refer to
the README in nltk_data/crubadan folder after installing it.

To translate ISO 639-3 codes to "Crubadan Code":

    >>> crubadan.iso_to_crubadan('eng')
    'en'
    >>> crubadan.iso_to_crubadan('fra')
    'fr'
    >>> crubadan.iso_to_crubadan('aaa')

In reverse, print ISO 639-3 code if we have the Crubadan Code:

    >>> crubadan.crubadan_to_iso('en')
    'eng'
    >>> crubadan.crubadan_to_iso('fr')
    'fra'
    >>> crubadan.crubadan_to_iso('aa')

---------------------------
Accessing ngram frequencies
---------------------------

On initialization the reader will create a dictionary of every
language supported by the Crubadan project, mapping the ISO 639-3
language code to its corresponding ngram frequency.

You can access individual language FreqDist and the ngrams within them as follows:

    >>> english_fd = crubadan.lang_freq('eng')
    >>> english_fd['the']
    728135

Above accesses the FreqDist of English and returns the frequency of the ngram 'the'.
A ngram that isn't found within the language will return 0:

    >>> english_fd['sometest']
    0

A language that isn't supported will raise an exception:

    >>> crubadan.lang_freq('elvish')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: Unsupported language.
