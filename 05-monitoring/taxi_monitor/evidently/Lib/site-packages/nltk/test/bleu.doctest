BLEU tests

>>> from nltk.translate import bleu

If the candidate has no alignment to any of the references, the BLEU score is 0.

>>> bleu(
...     ['The candidate has no alignment to any of the references'.split()],
...     'John loves Mary'.split(),
...     (1,),
... )
0

This is an implementation of the smoothing techniques
for segment-level BLEU scores that was presented in
Boxing Chen and Collin Cherry (2014) A Systematic Comparison of
Smoothing Techniques for Sentence-Level BLEU. In WMT14.
