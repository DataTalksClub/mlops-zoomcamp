Sentiment Analysis
===================

    >>> from nltk.classify import NaiveBayesClassifier
    >>> from nltk.corpus import subjectivity
    >>> from nltk.sentiment import SentimentAnalyzer
    >>> from nltk.sentiment.util import *

    >>> n_instances = 100
    >>> subj_docs = [(sent, 'subj') for sent in subjectivity.sents(categories='subj')[:n_instances]]
    >>> obj_docs = [(sent, 'obj') for sent in subjectivity.sents(categories='obj')[:n_instances]]
    >>> len(subj_docs), len(obj_docs)
    (100, 100)

Each document is represented by a tuple (sentence, label). The sentence is tokenized,
so it is represented by a list of strings:

    >>> subj_docs[0]
    (['smart', 'and', 'alert', ',', 'thirteen', 'conversations', 'about', 'one',
    'thing', 'is', 'a', 'small', 'gem', '.'], 'subj')

We separately split subjective and objective instances to keep a balanced uniform
class distribution in both train and test sets.

    >>> train_subj_docs = subj_docs[:80]
    >>> test_subj_docs = subj_docs[80:100]
    >>> train_obj_docs = obj_docs[:80]
    >>> test_obj_docs = obj_docs[80:100]
    >>> training_docs = train_subj_docs+train_obj_docs
    >>> testing_docs = test_subj_docs+test_obj_docs

    >>> sentim_analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer()
    >>> all_words_neg = sentim_analyzer.all_words([mark_negation(doc) for doc in training_docs])

We use simple unigram word features, handling negation:

    >>> unigram_feats = sentim_analyzer.unigram_word_feats(all_words_neg, min_freq=4)
    >>> len(unigram_feats)
    83
    >>> sentim_analyzer.add_feat_extractor(extract_unigram_feats, unigrams=unigram_feats)

We apply features to obtain a feature-value representation of our datasets:

    >>> training_set = sentim_analyzer.apply_features(training_docs)
    >>> test_set = sentim_analyzer.apply_features(testing_docs)

We can now train our classifier on the training set, and subsequently output the
evaluation results:

    >>> trainer = NaiveBayesClassifier.train
    >>> classifier = sentim_analyzer.train(trainer, training_set)
    Training classifier
    >>> for key,value in sorted(sentim_analyzer.evaluate(test_set).items()):
    ...     print('{0}: {1}'.format(key, value))
    Evaluating NaiveBayesClassifier results...
    Accuracy: 0.8
    F-measure [obj]: 0.8
    F-measure [subj]: 0.8
    Precision [obj]: 0.8
    Precision [subj]: 0.8
    Recall [obj]: 0.8
    Recall [subj]: 0.8
