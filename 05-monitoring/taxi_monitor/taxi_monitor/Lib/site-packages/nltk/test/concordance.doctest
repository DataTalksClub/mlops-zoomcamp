Concordance Example
==================================

A concordance view shows us every occurrence of a given
word, together with some context. Here we look up the word monstrous
in Moby Dick by entering text1 followed by a period, then the term
concordance, and then placing "monstrous" in parentheses:

>>> from nltk.corpus import gutenberg
>>> from nltk.text import Text
>>> corpus = gutenberg.words('melville-moby_dick.txt')
>>> text = Text(corpus)

>>> text.concordance("monstrous")
Displaying 11 of 11 matches:

ON OF THE PSALMS . " Touching that monstrous bulk of the whale or ork we have r

...

We can also search for a multi-word phrase by passing a list of strings:

>>> text.concordance(["monstrous", "size"])
Displaying 2 of 2 matches:
the former , one was of a most monstrous size . ... This came towards us , op

Concordance List
=================================

Often we need to store the results of concordance for further usage.
To do so, call the concordance function with the stdout argument set
to false:

>>> from nltk.corpus import gutenberg
>>> from nltk.text import Text
>>> corpus = gutenberg.words('melville-moby_dick.txt')
>>> text = Text(corpus)
>>> con_list = text.concordance_list("monstrous")
>>> con_list[2].line
'll over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears . Some were thick'
>>> len(con_list)
11

The left slice of the left context should be clip to 0 if the `i-context` < 0.

>>> from nltk import Text, word_tokenize
>>> jane_eyre = 'Chapter 1\nTHERE was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question.'
>>> text = Text(word_tokenize(jane_eyre))
>>> text.concordance_list('taking')[0].left
['Chapter', '1', 'THERE', 'was', 'no', 'possibility', 'of']
