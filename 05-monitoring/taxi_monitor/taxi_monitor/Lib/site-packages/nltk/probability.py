"""
Classes for representing and processing probabilistic information.

The ``FreqDist`` class is used to encode "frequency distributions",
which count the number of times that each outcome of an experiment
occurs.

The ``ProbDistI`` class defines a standard interface for "probability
distributions", which encode the probability of each outcome for an
experiment.  There are two types of probability distribution:

  - "derived probability distributions" are created from frequency
    distributions.  They attempt to model the probability distribution
    that generated the frequency distribution.
  - "analytic probability distributions" are created directly from
    parameters (such as variance).

The ``ConditionalFreqDist`` class and ``ConditionalProbDistI`` interface
are used to encode conditional distributions.  Conditional probability
distributions can be derived or analytic; but currently the only
implementation of the ``ConditionalProbDistI`` interface is
``ConditionalProbDist``, a derived distribution.

class FreqDist(Counter):

    A frequency distribution for the outcomes of an experiment.  A
    frequency distribution records the number of times each outcome of
    an experiment has occurred.  For example, a frequency distribution
    could be used to record the frequency of each word type in a
    document.  Formally, a frequency distribution can be defined as a
    function mapping from each sample to the number of times that
    sample occurred as an outcome.

    Frequency distributions are generally constructed by running a
    number of experiments, and incrementing the count for a sample
    every time it is an outcome of an experiment.  For example, the
    following code will produce a frequency distribution that encodes
    how often each word occurs in a text:

        >>> from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
        >>> from nltk.probability import FreqDist
        >>> sent = 'This is an example sentence'
        >>> fdist = FreqDist()
        >>> for word in word_tokenize(sent):
        ...    fdist[word.lower()] += 1

    An equivalent way to do this is with the initializer:

        >>> fdist = FreqDist(word.lower() for word in word_tokenize(sent))

        In particular, ``FreqDist()`` returns an empty frequency
        distribution; and ``FreqDist(samples)`` first creates an empty
        frequency distribution, and then calls ``update`` with the

##  Good-Turing Probability Distributions
##//////////////////////////////////////////////////////

# Good-Turing frequency estimation was contributed by Alan Turing and
# his statistical assistant I.J. Good, during their collaboration in
# the WWII.  It is a statistical technique for predicting the
# probability of occurrence of objects belonging to an unknown number
# of species, given past observations of such objects and their
# species. (In drawing balls from an urn, the 'objects' would be balls
# and the 'species' would be the distinct colors of the balls (finite
# but unknown in number).
#
# Good-Turing method calculates the probability mass to assign to
# events with zero or low counts based on the number of events with
# higher counts. It does so by using the adjusted count *c\**:
#
#     - *c\* = (c + 1) N(c + 1) / N(c)*   for c >= 1
#     - *things with frequency zero in training* = N(1)  for c == 0
#
# where *c* is the original count, *N(i)* is the number of event types
# observed with count *i*. We can think the count of unseen as the count
# of frequency one (see Jurafsky & Martin 2nd Edition, p101).
#
# This method is problematic because the situation ``N(c+1) == 0``
# is quite common in the original Good-Turing estimation; smoothing or
# interpolation of *N(i)* values is essential in practice.
#
# Bill Gale and Geoffrey Sampson present a simple and effective approach,
# Simple Good-Turing.  As a smoothing curve they simply use a power curve:
#
#     Nr = a*r^b (with b < -1 to give the appropriate hyperbolic
#     relationship)
#
# They estimate a and b by simple linear regression technique on the
# logarithmic form of the equation:
#
#     log Nr = a + b*log(r)
#
# However, they suggest that such a simple curve is probably only
# appropriate for high values of r. For low values of r, they use the
# measured Nr directly.  (see M&S, p.213)
#
# Gale and Sampson propose to use r while the difference between r and
# r* is 1.96 greater than the standard deviation, and switch to r* if
# it is less or equal:
#
#     |r - r*| > 1.96 * sqrt((r + 1)^2 (Nr+1 / Nr^2) (1 + Nr+1 / Nr))
#
# The 1.96 coefficient correspond to a 0.05 significance criterion,
# some implementations can use a coefficient of 1.65 for a 0.1
# significance criterion.

##  Kneser-Ney Probability Distribution
##//////////////////////////////////////////////////////

# This method for calculating probabilities was introduced in 1995 by Reinhard
# Kneser and Hermann Ney. It was meant to improve the accuracy of language
# models that use backing-off to deal with sparse data. The authors propose two
# ways of doing so: a marginal distribution constraint on the back-off
# distribution and a leave-one-out distribution. For a start, the first one is
# implemented as a class below.
#
# The idea behind a back-off n-gram model is that we have a series of
# frequency distributions for our n-grams so that in case we have not seen a
# given n-gram during training (and as a result have a 0 probability for it) we
# can 'back off' (hence the name!) and try testing whether we've seen the
# n-1-gram part of the n-gram in training.
#
# The novelty of Kneser and Ney's approach was that they decided to fiddle
# around with the way this latter, backed off probability was being calculated
# whereas their peers seemed to focus on the primary probability.
#
# The implementation below uses one of the techniques described in their paper
# titled "Improved backing-off for n-gram language modeling." In the same paper
# another technique is introduced to attempt to smooth the back-off
# distribution as well as the primary one. There is also a much-cited
# modification of this method proposed by Chen and Goodman.
#
# In order for the implementation of Kneser-Ney to be more efficient, some
# changes have been made to the original algorithm. Namely, the calculation of
# the normalizing function gamma has been significantly simplified and
# combined slightly differently with beta. None of these changes affect the
# nature of the algorithm, but instead aim to cut out unnecessary calculations
# and take advantage of storing and retrieving information in dictionaries
# where possible.

class ConditionalFreqDist(defaultdict):
    """
    A collection of frequency distributions for a single experiment
    run under different conditions.  Conditional frequency
    distributions are used to record the number of times each sample
    occurred, given the condition under which the experiment was run.
    For example, a conditional frequency distribution could be used to
    record the frequency of each word (type) in a document, given its
    length.  Formally, a conditional frequency distribution can be
    defined as a function that maps from each condition to the
    FreqDist for the experiment under that condition.

    Conditional frequency distributions are typically constructed by
    repeatedly running an experiment under a variety of conditions,
    and incrementing the sample outcome counts for the appropriate
    conditions.  For example, the following code will produce a
    conditional frequency distribution that encodes how often each
    word type occurs, given the length of that word type:

        >>> from nltk.probability import ConditionalFreqDist
        >>> from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
        >>> sent = "the the the dog dog some other words that we do not care about"
        >>> cfdist = ConditionalFreqDist()
        >>> for word in word_tokenize(sent):
        ...     condition = len(word)
        ...     cfdist[condition][word] += 1

    An equivalent way to do this is with the initializer:

        >>> cfdist = ConditionalFreqDist((len(word), word) for word in word_tokenize(sent))

    The frequency distribution for each condition is accessed using
    the indexing operator:

        >>> cfdist[3]
        FreqDist({'the': 3, 'dog': 2, 'not': 1})
        >>> cfdist[3].freq('the')
        0.5
        >>> cfdist[3]['dog']
        2

    When the indexing operator is used to access the frequency
    distribution for a condition that has not been accessed before,
    ``ConditionalFreqDist`` creates a new empty FreqDist for that
    condition.
