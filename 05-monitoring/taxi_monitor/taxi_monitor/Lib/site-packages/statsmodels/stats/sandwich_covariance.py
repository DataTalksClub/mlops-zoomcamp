Notes
-----

for calculating it, we have two versions

version 1: use pinv
pinv(x) scale pinv(x)   used currently in linear_model, with scale is
1d (or diagonal matrix)
(x'x)^(-1) x' scale x (x'x)^(-1),  scale in general is (nobs, nobs) so
pretty large general formulas for scale in cluster case are in [4],
which can be found (as of 2017-05-20) at
http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jbes.2010.07136
This paper also has the second version.

version 2:
(x'x)^(-1) S (x'x)^(-1)    with S = x' scale x,    S is (kvar,kvars),
(x'x)^(-1) is available as normalized_covparams.



S = sum (x*u) dot (x*u)' = sum x*u*u'*x'  where sum here can aggregate
over observations or groups. u is regression residual.

x is (nobs, k_var)
u is (nobs, 1)
x*u is (nobs, k_var)


For cluster robust standard errors, we first sum (x*w) over other groups
(including time) and then take the dot product (sum of outer products)

S = sum_g(x*u)' dot sum_g(x*u)
For HAC by clusters, we first sum over groups for each time period, and then
use HAC on the group sums of (x*w).
If we have several groups, we have to sum first over all relevant groups, and
then take the outer product sum. This can be done by summing using indicator
functions or matrices or with explicit loops. Alternatively we calculate
separate covariance matrices for each group, sum them and subtract the
duplicate counted intersection.

Not checked in details yet: degrees of freedom or small sample correction
factors, see (two) references (?)


This is the general case for MLE and GMM also

in MLE     hessian H, outerproduct of jacobian S,   cov_hjjh = HJJH,
which reduces to the above in the linear case, but can be used
generally, e.g. in discrete, and is misnomed in GenericLikelihoodModel

in GMM it's similar but I would have to look up the details, (it comes
out in sandwich form by default, it's in the sandbox), standard Newey
West or similar are on the covariance matrix of the moment conditions

quasi-MLE: MLE with mis-specified model where parameter estimates are
fine (consistent ?) but cov_params needs to be adjusted similar or
same as in sandwiches. (I did not go through any details yet.)

TODO
----
* small sample correction factors, Done for cluster, not yet for HAC
* automatic lag-length selection for Newey-West HAC,
  -> added: nlag = floor[4(T/100)^(2/9)]  Reference: xtscc paper, Newey-West
     note this will not be optimal in the panel context, see Peterson
* HAC should maybe return the chosen nlags
* get consistent notation, varies by paper, S, scale, sigma?
* replace diag(hat_matrix) calculations in cov_hc2, cov_hc3

    Assumes we have a panel of time series with consecutive, equal spaced time
    periods. Data is assumed to be in long format with time series of each
    individual stacked into one array. Panel can be unbalanced.

    Parameters
    ----------
    results : result instance
       result of a regression, uses results.model.exog and results.resid
       TODO: this should use wexog instead
    nlags : int or None
        Highest lag to include in kernel window. Currently, no default
        because the optimal length will depend on the number of observations
        per cross-sectional unit.
    groupidx : list of tuple
        each tuple should contain the start and end index for an individual.
        (groupidx might change in future).
    weights_func : callable
        weights_func is called with nlags as argument to get the kernel
        weights. default are Bartlett weights
    use_correction : 'cluster' or 'hac' or False
        If False, then no small sample correction is used.
        If 'cluster' (default), then the same correction as in cov_cluster is
        used.
        If 'hac', then the same correction as in single time series, cov_hac
        is used.


    Returns
    -------
    cov : ndarray, (k_vars, k_vars)
        HAC robust covariance matrix for parameter estimates

    Notes
    -----
    For nlags=0, this is just White covariance, cov_white.
    If kernel is uniform, `weights_uniform`, with nlags equal to the number
    of observations per unit in a balance panel, then cov_cluster and
    cov_hac_panel are identical.

    Tested against STATA `newey` command with same defaults.

    Options might change when other kernels besides Bartlett and uniform are
    available.

    '''Driscoll and Kraay Panel robust covariance matrix

    Robust covariance matrix for panel data of Driscoll and Kraay.

    Assumes we have a panel of time series where the time index is available.
    The time index is assumed to represent equal spaced periods. At least one
    observation per period is required.

    Parameters
    ----------
    results : result instance
       result of a regression, uses results.model.exog and results.resid
       TODO: this should use wexog instead
    nlags : int or None
        Highest lag to include in kernel window. Currently, no default
        because the optimal length will depend on the number of observations
        per cross-sectional unit.
    time : ndarray of int
        this should contain the coding for the time period of each observation.
        time periods should be integers in range(maxT) where maxT is obs of i
    weights_func : callable
        weights_func is called with nlags as argument to get the kernel
        weights. default are Bartlett weights
    use_correction : 'cluster' or 'hac' or False
        If False, then no small sample correction is used.
        If 'hac' (default), then the same correction as in single time series, cov_hac
        is used.
        If 'cluster', then the same correction as in cov_cluster is
        used.

    Returns
    -------
    cov : ndarray, (k_vars, k_vars)
        HAC robust covariance matrix for parameter estimates

    Notes
    -----
    Tested against STATA xtscc package, which uses no small sample correction

    This first averages relevant variables for each time period over all
    individuals/groups, and then applies the same kernel weighted averaging
    over time as in HAC.

    Warning:
    In the example with a short panel (few time periods and many individuals)
    with mainly across individual variation this estimator did not produce
    reasonable results.

    Options might change when other kernels besides Bartlett and uniform are
    available.
