rich-click is a minimal Python module to combine the efforts of the excellent packages 'rich' and 'click'.

The intention is to provide attractive help output from Click, formatted with Rich, with minimal
customisation required.

# Import the entire click API here.
# We need to manually import these instead of `from click import *` to force
# mypy to recognize a few type annotation overrides for the rich_click decorators.
