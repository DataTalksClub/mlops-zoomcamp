What is Pylint?
Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for code smells, and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.

pipenv install --dev pylint

#run pylint on all the files and folders under the current working directory which has a .py extension
pylint --recursive=y .

select Linter in VSCode shift+ctrl+p 

https://www.codeac.io/documentation/pylint-configuration.html

use .pylintrc file to configure which pylint warnings can be ignored

you can use pyproject.toml to configure linting for your project instead of pylint

## library for formatting
pipenv install --dev black 

## libary for sorting import of libraries
pipenv install --dev isort
