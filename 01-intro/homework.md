## 1.6 Homework

The goal of this homework is to train a simple model for predicting the duration of a ride - similar to what we did in this module.


## Q1. Downloading the data

We'll use [the same NYC taxi dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page),
but instead of "Green Taxi Trip Records", we'll use "For-Hire Vehicle Trip Records".

Download the data for January and February 2021.

Note that you need "For-Hire Vehicle Trip Records", not "High Volume For-Hire Vehicle Trip Records".

Read the data for January. How many records are there?

* 1054112
* 1154112
* 1254112
* 1354112


## Q2. Computing duration

Now let's compute the `duration` variable. It should contain the duration of a ride in minutes. 

What's the average trip duration in January?

* 15.16
* 19.16
* 24.16
* 29.16

## Data preparation

Check the distribution of the duration variable. There are some outliers. 

Let's remove them and keep only the records where the duration was between 1 and 60 minutes (inclusive).

How many records did you drop? 

## Q3. Missing values

The features we'll use for our model are the pickup and dropoff location IDs. 

But they have a lot of missing values there. Let's replace them with "-1".

What's the fractions of missing values for the pickup location ID? I.e. fraction of "-1"s after you filled the NAs.

* 53%
* 63%
* 73%
* 83%

## Q4. One-hot encoding

Let's apply one-hot encoding to the pickup and dropoff location IDs. We'll use only these two features for our model. 

* Turn the dataframe into a list of dictionaries
* Fit a dictionary vectorizer 
* Get a feature matrix from it

What's the dimensionality of this matrix? (The number of columns).

* 2
* 152
* 352
* 525
* 725

## Q5. Training a model

Now let's use the feature matrix from the previous step to train a model. 

* Train a plain linear regression model with default parameters 
* Calculate the RMSE of the model on the training data

What's the RMSE on train?

* 5.52
* 10.52
* 15.52
* 20.52


## Q6. Evaluating the model

Now let's apply this model to the validation dataset (Feb 2021). 

What's the RMSE on validation?

* 6.01
* 11.01
* 16.01
* 21.01
