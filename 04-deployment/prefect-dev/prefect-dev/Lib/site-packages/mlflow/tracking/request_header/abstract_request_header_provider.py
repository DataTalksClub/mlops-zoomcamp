class RequestHeaderProvider:
    """
    Abstract base class for specifying custom request headers to add to outgoing requests
    (e.g. request headers specifying the environment from which mlflow is running).

    When a request is sent, MLflow will iterate through all registered RequestHeaderProviders.
    For each provider where ``in_context`` returns ``True``, MLflow calls the ``request_headers``
    method on the provider to compute request headers.

    All resulting request headers will then be merged together and sent with the request.
