# 3.0 Introduction: ML pipelines and Mage

# What is MLOps

> Operationalizing ML models involves moving them from development to production to drive business value.

## Step 1

Preparing the model for deployment involves optimizing performance, ensuring it handles real-world data, and packaging it for integration into existing systems.


## Step 2

Deploying the model involves moving it from development to production, making it accessible to users and applications.


## Step 3

Once deployed, models must be continuously monitored for accuracy and reliability, and may need retraining on new data and updates to maintain effectiveness.


## Step 4

The operationalized model must be integrated into existing workflows, applications, and decision-making processes to drive business impact.



> Effective operationalization enables organizations to move beyond experimentation and drive tangible value from ML at scale, powering intelligent applications that personalize the customer experience and creates real business value.


# Why we need to operationalize ML

## 1. Productivity

MLOps fosters collaboration between data scientists, ML engineers, and DevOps teams by providing a unified environment for experiment tracking, feature engineering, model management, and deployment. This breaks down silos and accelerates the entire machine learning lifecycle.


## 2. Reliability

MLOps ensures high-quality, reliable models in production through clean datasets, proper testing, validation, CI/CD practices, monitoring, and governance.


## 3. Reproducibility

MLOps enables reproducibility and compliance by versioning datasets, code, and models, providing transparency and auditability to ensure adherence to policies and regulations.


## 4. Time-to-value

MLOps streamlines the ML lifecycle, enabling organizations to successfully deploy more projects to production and derive tangible business value and ROI from AI/ML investments at scale.



# How Mage helps MLOps

## 1. Data preparation

Mage offers features to build, run, and manage data pipelines for data transformation and integration, including pipeline orchestration, notebook environments, data integrations, and streaming pipelines for real-time data.


## 2. Training and deployment

Mage helps prepare data, train machine learning models, and deploy them with accessible API endpoints.


## 3. Standardize complex processes

Mage simplifies MLOps by providing a unified platform for data pipelining, model development, deployment, versioning, CI/CD, and maintenance, allowing developers to focus on model creation while improving efficiency and collaboration.

If you havenâ€™t setup your project yet, please refer to the [quickstart guide](../README.md#Quickstart) or follow these steps:

1. Clone the following respository containing the complete code for this module:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mage-ai/mlops.git
    cd mlops
    ```

1. Launch Mage and the database service (PostgreSQL):

    ```bash
    ./scripts/start.sh
    ```

    If don't have bash in your enviroment, modify the following command and run it:

    ```bash
    PROJECT_NAME=mlops \
        MAGE_CODE_PATH=/home/src \
        SMTP_EMAIL=$SMTP_EMAIL \
        SMTP_PASSWORD=$SMTP_PASSWORD \
        docker compose up
    ```
    It is ok if you get this warning, you can ignore it  
     `The "PYTHONPATH" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.`

1. The subproject that contains all the pipelines and code is named
   [`unit_3_observability`](https://github.com/mage-ai/mlops/tree/master/mlops/unit_3_observability)

## Run example pipeline

1. Open [`http://localhost:6789`](http://localhost:6789) in your browser.

1. In the top left corner of the screen next to the Mage logo and **`mlops`** project name,
   click the project selector dropdown and choose the **`unit_0_setup`** option.

1. Click on the pipeline named **`example_pipeline`**.
1. Click on the button labeled **`Run @once`**.
