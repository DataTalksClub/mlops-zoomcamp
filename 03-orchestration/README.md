## Quickstart

1. Clone the following respository containing the complete code for this module:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/mage-ai/mlops.git
    ```

1. Change directory into the cloned repo:

    ```
    cd mlops
    ```

1. Launch Mage and the database service (PostgreSQL):

    ```
    ./scripts/start.sh
    ```

1. The subproject that contains all the pipelines and code is named
   [`unit_3_observability`](https://github.com/mage-ai/mlops/tree/master/mlops/unit_3_observability)
