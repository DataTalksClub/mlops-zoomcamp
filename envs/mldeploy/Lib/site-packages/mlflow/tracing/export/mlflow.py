    An exporter implementation that logs the traces to MLflow.

    MLflow backend (will) only support logging the complete trace, not incremental updates
    for spans, so this exporter is designed to aggregate the spans into traces in memory.
    Therefore, this only works within a single process application and not intended to work
    in a distributed environment. For the same reason, this exporter should only be used with
    SimpleSpanProcessor.

    If we want to support distributed tracing, we should first implement an incremental trace
    logging in MLflow backend, then we can get rid of the in-memory trace aggregation.
