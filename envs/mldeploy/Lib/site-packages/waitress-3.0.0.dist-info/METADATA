Waitress is a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very acceptable
performance. It has no dependencies except ones which live in the Python
standard library. It runs on CPython on Unix and Windows under Python 3.8+. It
is also known to run on PyPy 3 (version 3.8 compatible python and above) on
UNIX. It supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.

3.0.0 (2024-02-04)
------------------

- Rename "master" git branch to "main"

- Fix a bug that would appear on macOS whereby if we accept() a socket that is
  already gone, setting socket options would fail and take down the server. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/399

- Fixed testing of vendored asyncore code to not rely on particular naming for
  errno's. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/397

- HTTP Request methods and versions are now validated to meet the HTTP
  standards thereby dropping invalid requests on the floor. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/423

- No longer close the connection when sending a HEAD request response. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/428

- Always attempt to send the Connection: close response header when we are
  going to close the connection to let the remote know in more instances.
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/429

- Python 3.7 is no longer supported. Add support for Python 3.11, 3.12 and
  PyPy 3.9, 3.10. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/412

- Document that trusted_proxy may be set to a wildcard value to trust all
  proxies. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/431

Updated Defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- clear_untrusted_proxy_headers is set to True by default. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/370
