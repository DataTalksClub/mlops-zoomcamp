## Overview

### Objective

Teach practical aspects of productionizing ML services â€” from training and experimenting to model deployment and monitoring.

### Target audience

Data scientists and ML engineers. Also software engineers and data engineers interested in learning about putting ML in production.

### Pre-requisites

* Python
* Docker
* Being comfortable with command line 
* Prior exposure to machine learning (at work or from other courses, e.g. from [ML Zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp))
* Prior programming experience (at least 1+ year)



### Asking for help in Slack

## FAQ

**I want to start preparing for the course. What can I do?**

If you haven't used Flask or Docker

* Check [Module 5](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/05-deployment) from ML Zoomcamp
* The [section about Docker](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/week_1_basics_n_setup/2_docker_sql) from Data Engineering Zoomcamp could also be useful

If you have no previous experience with ML

* Check [Module 1](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/01-intro) from ML Zoomcamp for an overview
* [Module 3](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/03-classification) will also be helpful if you want to learn Scikit-Learn (we'll use it in this course)
* We'll also use XGBoost. You don't have to know it well, but if you want to learn more about it, refer to [module 6](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/06-trees) of ML Zoomcamp


**I registered but haven't received an invite link. Is it normal?**

Yes, we haven't automated it. You'll get a mail from us eventually, don't worry.

If you want to make sure you don't miss anything:

* Register in [our Slack](https://datatalks.club/slack.html) and join the `#course-mlops-zoomcamp` channel
* Subscribe to [our YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/datatalksclub)

**Is it going to be live?**

No and yes. There will be two parts:

* Lectures: Pre-recorded, you can watch them when it's convenient for you. 
* Office hours: Live on Mondays (17:00 CET), but recorded, so you can watch later.


**I just joined. Can I still get a certificate?**

* To get a certificate, you need to complete a project
* There will be two attempts to do a project
* First: in July, second: in August
* If you manage to finish all the materials till August, and successfully finish the project, you'll get the certificate
