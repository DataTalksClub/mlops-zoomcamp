## Asking questions

If you have any questions, ask them 
in the [`#course-mlops-zoomcamp`](https://app.slack.com/client/T01ATQK62F8/C02R98X7DS9) channel in [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club) slack.

To keep our discussion in Slack more organized, we ask you to follow these suggestions:

* Before asking a question, check [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12TlBfhIiKtyBv8RnsoJR6F72bkPDGEvPOItJIxaEzE0/edit).
* Use threads. When you have a problem, first describe the problem shortly
  and then put the actual error in the thread - so it doesn't take the entire screen.
* Instead of screenshots, it's better to copy-paste the error you're getting in text.
  Use ` ``` ` for formatting your code.
  It's very difficult to read text from screenshots.
* Please don't take pictures of your code with a phone. It's even harder to read. Follow the previous suggestion,
  and in rare cases when you need to show what happens on your screen, take a screenshot.
* You don't need to tag the instructors when you have a problem. We will see it eventually.
* If somebody helped you with your problem and it's not in [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12TlBfhIiKtyBv8RnsoJR6F72bkPDGEvPOItJIxaEzE0/edit), please add it there.
  It'll help other students.
