class LinearModelLoss:
    """General class for loss functions with raw_prediction = X @ coef + intercept.

    Note that raw_prediction is also known as linear predictor.

    The loss is the average of per sample losses and includes a term for L2
    regularization::

        loss = 1 / s_sum * sum_i s_i loss(y_i, X_i @ coef + intercept)
               + 1/2 * l2_reg_strength * ||coef||_2^2

    with sample weights s_i=1 if sample_weight=None and s_sum=sum_i s_i.

    Gradient and hessian, for simplicity without intercept, are::

        gradient = 1 / s_sum * X.T @ loss.gradient + l2_reg_strength * coef
        hessian = 1 / s_sum * X.T @ diag(loss.hessian) @ X
                  + l2_reg_strength * identity

    Conventions:
        if fit_intercept:
            n_dof =  n_features + 1
        else:
            n_dof = n_features

        if base_loss.is_multiclass:
            coef.shape = (n_classes, n_dof) or ravelled (n_classes * n_dof,)
        else:
            coef.shape = (n_dof,)

        The intercept term is at the end of the coef array:
        if base_loss.is_multiclass:
            if coef.shape (n_classes, n_dof):
                intercept = coef[:, -1]
            if coef.shape (n_classes * n_dof,)
                intercept = coef[n_features::n_dof] = coef[(n_dof-1)::n_dof]
            intercept.shape = (n_classes,)
        else:
            intercept = coef[-1]

    Note: If coef has shape (n_classes * n_dof,), the 2d-array can be reconstructed as

        coef.reshape((n_classes, -1), order="F")

    The option order="F" makes coef[:, i] contiguous. This, in turn, makes the
    coefficients without intercept, coef[:, :-1], contiguous and speeds up
    matrix-vector computations.

    Note: If the average loss per sample is wanted instead of the sum of the loss per
    sample, one can simply use a rescaled sample_weight such that
    sum(sample_weight) = 1.
