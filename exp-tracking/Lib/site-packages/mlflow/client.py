"""
The ``mlflow.client`` module provides a Python CRUD interface to MLflow Experiments, Runs,
Model Versions, and Registered Models. This is a lower level API that directly translates to MLflow
`REST API <../rest-api.html>`_ calls.
For a higher level API for managing an "active run", use the :py:mod:`mlflow` module.
