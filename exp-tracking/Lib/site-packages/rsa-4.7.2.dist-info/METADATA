Pure Python RSA implementation

[Python-RSA](https://stuvel.eu/rsa) is a pure-Python RSA implementation. It supports
encryption and decryption, signing and verifying signatures, and key
generation according to PKCS#1 version 1.5. It can be used as a Python
library as well as on the commandline. The code was mostly written by
Sybren A.  St√ºvel.

Documentation can be found at the [Python-RSA homepage](https://stuvel.eu/rsa). For all changes, check [the changelog](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Download and install using:

    pip install rsa

or download it from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/rsa/).

Security
--------

Because of how Python internally stores numbers, it is very hard (if not impossible) to make a pure-Python program secure against timing attacks. This library is no exception, so use it with care. See https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2018/08/03/constant-time-compare-in-python/ for more info.


Major changes in 4.1
--------------------

Version 4.0 was the last version to support Python 2 and 3.4. Version 4.1 is compatible with Python 3.5+ only.


Major changes in 4.0
--------------------

Version 3.4 was the last version in the 3.x range. Version 4.0 drops the following modules,
as they are insecure:

- `rsa._version133`
- `rsa._version200`
- `rsa.bigfile`
- `rsa.varblock`

Those modules were marked as deprecated in version 3.4.

Furthermore, in 4.0 the I/O functions is streamlined to always work with bytes on all
supported versions of Python.

Version 4.0 drops support for Python 2.6 and 3.3.
