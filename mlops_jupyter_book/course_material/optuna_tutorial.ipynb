    "# Module 2 - Optuna for Hyperparameter Tuning\n",

    "## Why Optuna?\n",
    "\n",
    "Optuna is seen to be the gold standard in hyperparameter tuning, outshining the like of sklearn, skopt and hyperopt because it plugs gaps that all of these have (such as visualisations, integrations, bayesian search etc). Optuna has a very similar API to what hyperopt has so if you want to make the switch it should be fairly straight forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optuna has built itself on 5 pillar that make it stand out as a hyperparameter optimisation module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lightweight, versatile, and platform agnostic architecture\n",
    "    - Handle a wide variety of tasks with a simple installation that has few requirements.\n",
    "2. Pythonic search spaces\n",
    "    - Define search spaces using familiar Python syntax including conditionals and loops.\n",
    "3. Efficient optimization algorithms\n",
    "    - Adopt state-of-the-art algorithms for sampling hyperparameters and efficiently pruning unpromising trials.\n",
    "4. Easy parallelization\n",
    "    - Scale studies to tens or hundreds or workers with little or no changes to the code.\n",
    "5. Quick visualization\n",
    "    - Inspect optimization histories from a variety of plotting functions."

    "Think of an objective as what we are trying to solve for. Usually this means we are trying to minimise or maximise a value (Log Loss, RMSE etc.).

    "## Pruning\n",
    "[Pruning](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0.0/tutorial/pruning.html) is a fantastic feature in Optuna that allows early stopping if a particular set of hyperparameters seems to be far worse than the best configuration we have already found. It works by looking at each step of a model being trained and assess its performance, comparing it to the perfromance of our previous models at the same step. This is a great way to remove redundant trials and speed up the hyperparameter search\n",
    "\n",
    "This works for any model that learns incrementally and that we can access these incremental steps. Examples are:\n",
    "- SGD Regressor / Classifiers\n",
    "- XGBoost\n",
    "- Pytorch\n",
    "- catboost etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__: You can implement pruning for other models such as Random Forest, Linear Reg etc. in Sklearn, the issue is there is no partial observability so you only know if the trial should be pruned or not after the trial is finished which defeats the purpose"
