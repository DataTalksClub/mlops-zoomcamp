# DataTalksClub MlOps-Zoomcamp Jupyter Book

Hello! This is my Jupyter Book which will (hopefully!) contain all of my homeworks as part of my Journey
though the DataTalksClub MlOps-Zoomcamp. I could see that the homeworks look like they will mostly be done in Jupyter Notebooks 
and I thought this would be an interesting and cool way to share them with whoever is interested

If anyone wants to see any of the code related to this project feel free to checkout the link to my Github which can be 
found in the top right corner of this book!

A link to each homework can be found below :)
